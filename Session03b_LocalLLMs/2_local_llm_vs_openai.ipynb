      "- Where and people: Northern South America, bordered by Colombia, Brazil, Guyana, and the Caribbean. Capital and largest city: Caracas. Official language: Spanish. Population roughly in the tens of millions; significant diaspora abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Geography and nature: Very diverse scenery—Andes in the west, vast Llanos plains, the Amazon rainforest’s edge in the south, and a long Caribbean coast. Notable sights include Angel Falls and Canaima National Park; rich biodiversity and many national parks.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Economy: Historically oil-rich; crude oil has been the backbone of the economy. In recent years the country faced a severe economic crisis, with hyperinflation, currency volatility, shortages of goods, and a large emigration. Sanctions and governance tensions have also shaped the economy and daily life.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Politics and society: Long-running political tensions between the government and opposition. Since the 2010s, leadership and legitimacy have been contested by many domestic and international actors. The situation remains dynamic, affecting public services, security, and everyday life.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Culture and daily life: Rich cultural traditions, including music (joropo, salsa), dance, and a cuisine featuring arepas, pabellón criollo, and hallacas. Baseball is popular; Venezuelan literature and art have notable figures as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Travel and safety notes: Safety can vary by region; demonstrations and civil unrest can occur. If you’re planning a visit, check current travel advisories, have flexible plans, and be mindful of cash and payment options in markets and smaller towns.\n",
